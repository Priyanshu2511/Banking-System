#Banking System

The Banking System REST API is a Java-based backend application built with Spring Boot that simulates core banking functionalities. It provides secure and scalable endpoints to handle user registration, authentication, account management, balance inquiry, fund transfers, and transaction history. The project follows RESTful principles and integrates with an SQL database for data persistence.
